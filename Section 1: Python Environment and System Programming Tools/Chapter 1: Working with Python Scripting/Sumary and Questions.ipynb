We\n","also reviewed functions, managing exceptions, and how to create classes and objects, as well as\n","the use of attributes and special methods. Then we looked at development environments and a\n","methodology to introduce into programming with Python. Finally, we reviewed the main development environments, PyCharm and Python IDLE, for script development in Python.\n","\n","In the next chapter, we will explore programming system packages for working with operating\n","systems and filesystems, threads, and concurrency.\n","## Questions\n","As we conclude, here is a list of questions for you to test your knowledge regarding this chapterâ€™s\n","material. You will find the answers in the Assessments section of the Appendix:\n","1. Which data structure in Python allows us to associate values with keys?\n","2. What are the methods we can use to add elements to a list?\n","3. What is the approach that we can follow in Python to handle files and manage exceptions\n","in an easy and secure way?\n","4.\n","What is the Python parent class for errors related to input/output?\n","5. What are the Python modules that enable you to build virtual environments?\n","## Further reading\n","In these links, you will find more information about the aforementioned tools and the official\n","Python documentation for some of the modules we have analyzed:\n","* Python 3.10 version library: https://docs.python.org/3.10/library\n","* Virtualenv documentation: https://virtualenv.pypa.io/en/latest/\n","* Python Integrated Development Environments: https://wiki.python.org/moin/Int\n","egratedDevelopmentEnvironments"],"metadata":{"id":"11nKoi3NFD0T"}}]}
