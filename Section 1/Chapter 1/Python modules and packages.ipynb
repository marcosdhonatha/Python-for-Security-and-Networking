The elements created in a module (functions, classes, …) can be imported to be used in another module.

The packages, at the same time, can also contain other sub-packages.\n","\n","## Managing parameters in Python\n","Often in Python, scripts that are used on the command line as arguments are used to give users options when they run a certain command. To develop this task, one of the options is to use the argparse module, which comes installed by default when you install Python.\n","\n","One of the interesting choices is that the type of parameter can be indicated using the type attribute.
