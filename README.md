# Python-for-Security-and-Networking
I am currently studying Python focused on security through this book, I hope to be able to share all the content through my notes made on Google Colab :)


I would like to highlight that I am not interested in creating or sharing another copy of the book, but rather a version with my notes and in an environment that is easy to run the codes.
